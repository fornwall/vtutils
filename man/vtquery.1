.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm vtquery
utility queries the current terminal for terminfo or termcap capabilities.

It uses the following section from the XTerm Control Sequences (http://invisible-island.net/xterm/ctlseqs/ctlseqs.html) document:

	DCS + q Pt ST
	Request Termcap/Terminfo String (xterm, experimental).  The
	string following the "q" is a list of names encoded in hexadecimal
	(2 digits per character) separated by ; which correspond to termcap
	or terminfo key names.
	Two special features are also recognized, which are not key
	names: Co for termcap colors (or colors for terminfo colors),
	and TN for termcap name (or name for terminfo name).
	xterm responds with DCS 1 + r Pt ST for valid requests, adding
	to Pt an = , and the value of the corresponding string that
	xterm would send, or DCS 0 + r Pt ST for invalid requests.
	The strings are encoded in hexadecimal (2 digits per character).
